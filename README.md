Basic language guessing app using node.js

After cloning the repo into your computer
1. Open the terminal and run
<code>'npm install'</code>
2. After the dependencies are installed, run <code> node index.js 'language input that you want to detect'</code> in the terminal.

For example; 
<code>node index.js 'Cest la vie' </code> will be detected as FRENCH. 
Try it :)
